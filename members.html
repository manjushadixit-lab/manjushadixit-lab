                bio: 'The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), also known as the panda bear or simply panda, is a bear species endemic to China. It is characterised by its white coat with black patches around the eyes, ears, legs and shoulders. Its body is rotund; adult individuals weigh 100 to 115 kg (220 to 254 lb) and are typically 1.2 to 1.9 m (3 ft 11 in to 6 ft 3 in) long. It is sexually dimorphic, with males being typically 10 to 20% larger than females. A thumb is visible on its forepaw, which helps in holding bamboo in place for feeding. It has large molar teeth and expanded temporal fossa to meet its dietary requirements. It can digest starch and is mostly herbivorous with a diet consisting almost entirely of bamboo and bamboo shoots.'

Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, and Eurasia. Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.'

I split my time between looking through molecular pathways and overthinking brush strokes in my sketchbook. When I’m not pipetting things in the lab or digging through research papers, you’ll probably find me humming a tune, switching playlists mid-song. But when I’m in the lab, mid-experiment, I’m all in—focused, precise, and fully committed to the science. My current research focuses on Elucidating the role of SPINK1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). I worked under MD Lab during the summer of 2025, where I explored how SPINK1 influences tumor progression; navigating through various wet lab techniques. This project has sharpened my skills in experimental design, molecular analysis —solidifying my passion for cancer biology and translational research.',

                bio: "Dr. Dixit's research interest is to understand the genetics and molecular biology of various human genetic diseases, especially cancer. My research group is interested towards the validation and elucidation of the molecular mechanism of putative angiogenic regulators. We are also interested in finding out the role and molecular mechanism of these newly identified angiogenesis regulators, in tumorigenesis and tumor angiogenesis. We started with FRG1 (a putative angiogenic regulator) and further research led to identification of EEF1A2 and IQGAP2, as its interacting partners. Currently, we have established FRG1 to have reduced expression in cancer and its effect on various properties of cells (proliferation, migration and invasion). We found that IQGAP2 expression is also reduced but the expression of EEF1A2 is increased in tumor tissues. We discovered the mechanism of, how FRG1 and IQGAP2 behave as tumor suppressor genes but EEF1A2 behaves as an oncogene. Our data suggests that all three genes may impart tumorigenic potential by affecting angiogenesis. Another major area of our research includes understanding molecular mechanism of gallbladder cancer and establishment of genetic risk factors in Indian population. So far, we have found that SNPs present in MMP14 affect it’s expression and might be responsible for altered risk in the population of Odisha.",

                bio: "I am working with IQGAP2, a member of the scaffolding protein family IQGAPs, to investigate its role in glioblastoma (GBM), an aggressive primary brain tumor with poor prognosis and median survival of less than 15 months despite current therapies. Although IQGAP2 is widely reported as a tumor suppressor, its paradoxical elevation in brain cancer patients suggests a context-dependent function that may contribute to tumor progression. My work combines bioinformatic analyses—including patient expression profiling, survival correlations, and pathway enrichment—with experimental studies to assess IQGAP2’s influence on glioblastoma biology. A particular focus is its interaction with IQGAP1 and its potential involvement in glutamate/NMDAR signalling, a pathway implicated in both tumor-associated epilepsy and GBM progression, aiming to uncover mechanistic links between oncogenesis and neurological symptoms.",
